GUIComp provides instant feedback on user\u2019s current design, such as visual complexity scores, end-users\u2019 attention heatmap, and recommended designs. I am the third author, and I implemented the front-end of the system. It is accepted by ACM CHI 2020. Internship at Interactive Visual Analysis & Data Exploration Reasearch Lab, UNIST Supervisor : Prof. Sung-Ahn Ko and Prof. Young-Woo Park, UNIST Period: June \u201917 - Dec. \u201917 In this project, we built AirScope, a prototype AR device using Arduino UNO. It is aimed to intuitively show how much fine dusts there are in the air around users. I've gained experience collaborating with researchers from the Design perspective. It earned Creative Award at HCI Korea '18 Intership at High-performance Visual Computing Lab, UNIST Supervisor : Prof. Won-Ki Jeong, UNIST Period: Nov. \u201912 - February \u201913 I implement a program reconstructing the perpendicular images from parallel cross-sectional brain images in high resolution using C++ and OpenCV.

So, it can be said that the visual analytics is a process of Human-computer interaction via visualization techniques to interpret data. To start this process, transforming the data into proper form, such as data cleaning, normalization and standardization as known as data preprocessing, is a necessary step before data mining or visualization step. After that, analysists can analyze it starting with visualization or data mining models and keep moving these two states refining parameters until they find something new insights.","title":"Visualanalytics"},{"location":"visualanalytics/#assignment-0-visual-analytics","text":"Summary : The visual analytics is an integration of several disciplines such as data management, data mining, and human perception and cognition including building infrastructure to find insights from data.
