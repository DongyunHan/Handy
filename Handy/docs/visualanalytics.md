Summary : The visual analytics is an integration of several disciplines such as data management, data mining, and human perception and cognition including building infrastructure to find insights from data. So, it can be said that the visual analytics is a process of Human-computer interaction via visualization techniques to interpret data. To start this process, transforming the data into proper form, such as data cleaning, normalization and standardization as known as data preprocessing, is a necessary step before data mining or visualization step. After that, analysists can analyze it starting with visualization or data mining models and keep moving these two states refining parameters until they find something new insights.
