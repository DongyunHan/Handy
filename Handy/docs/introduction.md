<!-- #### HisVA: A Visual Analytics System for Learning History

- Supervisor : Prof. Sung-Ahn Ko, UNIST
- Period: Jan. 2019 -  Present
- This project is aimed to support students to learn history. HisVA is a visualization system providing visual interfaces (e.g., map, timeline, and list of events) helping students explore various historical events and analyze them.
- I am the first author in this project, and I've gained experience working with multidisciplinary researchers major in cognitive science, education, and history.
- Preparing to submit the paper.  -->

#### GUIComp: A GUI Design Assistant with Real-Time, Multi-Faceted Feedback

- Supervisor : Prof. Sung-Ahn Ko, UNIST
- Period: June 2018 - Dec. 2019
- This project is aimed to support novice designers in designing Mobile GUI process. GUIComp provides instant feedback on user’s current design, such as visual complexity scores, end-users’ attention heatmap, and recommended designs.
- I am the third author, and I implemented the front-end of the system.
- It is accepted by ACM CHI 2020.

#### **Internship** at Interactive Visual Analysis & Data Exploration Reasearch Lab, UNIST </br>

- Supervisor : Prof. Sung-Ahn Ko and Prof. Young-Woo Park, UNIST
- Period: June ’17 - Dec. ’17
- In this project, we built AirScope, a prototype AR device using Arduino UNO. It is aimed to intuitively show how much fine dusts there are in the air around users.
- I've gained experience collaborating with researchers from the Design perspective.
- It earned Creative Award at HCI Korea '18

#### **Intership** at High-performance Visual Computing Lab, UNIST </br>

- Supervisor : Prof. Won-Ki Jeong, UNIST
- Period: Nov. ’12 - February ’13
- I implement a program reconstructing the perpendicular images from parallel cross-sectional brain images in high resolution using C++ and OpenCV.
- I learned OpenCV, a library for computer vision.
  <!-- - Research about _"Reconstructing Perpendicular Images from Multi-Scale Images of the Brain"_ -->
  <!-- - I Down sampled images from set of several parallel cross-sectional images of the brain in high resolu- tion, reconstruct the perpendicular images in clear resolution -->

#### **Internship** at Biomathematics Lab, UNIST. </br>

- Supervisor : Prof. Chang-Hyeong Lee, UNIST
- Period: March ’12 - May ’12
- I participated the research project developing mathematical infection model for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, a.k.a. camel flu).
- I got the experience of applying mathematics to the real world.
  <!-- - Present Poster about **_"Representing Diagram for How MERS-CoV is Spreaded"_** -->
  <!-- - Represented a diagram how infectees will be infected,cured or died by describing each nodes for possible states of infectees and each links for percentage of change from state A to state B -->

<!--
Supervisor : Prof. Sung-Ahn Ko, UNIST June ’18 - Sep.’18
- Under Submitting to ACM UIST ’19 as the third author
- Interviewed with 16 novice developers to understand their problems with an existing tool
- Built a mobile GUI prototyping tool in Google Extension that provides instant feedback on users design -->
